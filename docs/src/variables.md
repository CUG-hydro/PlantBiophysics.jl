# Variables

There are so many variables in PlantBiophysics that it can be difficult to remember what is their name, what are they describing or what is their unit.

To get all variables used in PlantBiophysics, you can use [`variables`](@ref) without any argument:

```@example
using PlantBiophysics
variables()
```
