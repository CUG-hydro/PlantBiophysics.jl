# [Light interception](@id light_page)

```@setup usepkg

The light interception process is the process of computing the radiation interception of the components for different wavelength such as PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radication), NIR (Near-Infrared Radiation) and eventually TIR (Thermal Infrared Radiation). Users can also compute particular wavelengths (*e.g.* red, far-red) depending on the model used.

There is no light interception model implemented in PlantBiophysics at the time.

    If you have a 3D plant in the OPF format, you can use [Archimed-Ï•](https://archimed-platform.github.io/archimed-phys-user-doc/).
